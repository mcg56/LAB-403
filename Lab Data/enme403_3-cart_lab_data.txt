ENME403 3-cart lab data is stored in a MATLAB structure. In
order to access the data in the MATLAB workspace, you will need
to do the following.

1.  Load the '.mat' file into MATLAB:

    >> load example.mat

    You may type the name of the resulting workspace variable
    and hit enter to view the various substructures:

    >> example

    example = 

              X: [1x1 struct]
              Y: [1x15 struct]
    Description: [1x1 struct]
      RTProgram: [1x1 struct]
        Capture: [1x1 struct]

    The 'X' structure contains timestep data, whilst the the 'Y'
    structure contains the variables that were captured at each
    timestep. Lets have a closer look at the variable structure:

    >> example.Y

    ans = 

    1x15 struct array with fields:
        Name
        Type
        Data
        Unit
        XIndex

    MATLAB has very conventiently stored the names of the FIFTEEN
    variables that it captured in the 'Name' field. To see
    what the variable names are, type the following:

    >> example.Y.Name

    You will get a list of rather terse acronyms in response. The
    expanded variable names are:

    C1P Cart 1 Position [m]
    C1P_GAIN Cart 1 Position Gain
    C1V Cart 1 Velocity [m/s]
    C1V_GAIN Cart 1 Velocity Gain

    C2P Cart 2 Position [m]
    C2P_GAIN Cart 2 Position Gain
    C2V Cart 2 Velocity [m/s]
    C2V_GAIN Cart 2 Velocity Gain

    C3P Cart 3 Position [m]
    C3P_GAIN Cart 3 Position Gain
    C3V Cart 3 Velocity [m/s]
    C3V_GAIN Cart 3 Velocity Gain

    CMV Cart Motor Voltage [V]
    PC Cart Position Command [m]
    RMV Raw Motor Voltage [V]

    Note that CMV is prior to 12V clipping, and RMV is after.

2.  Save the 'X' and 'Y' data into the workspace:

    time_data = example.X(1).Data;
	
    C1P = example.Y(1).Data;
    C1P_GAIN = example.Y(2).Data;
    C1V = example.Y(3).Data;
    C1V_GAIN = example.Y(4).Data;

    C2P = example.Y(5).Data;
    C2P_GAIN = example.Y(6).Data;
    C2V = example.Y(7).Data;
    C2V_GAIN = example.Y(8).Data;

    C3P = example.Y(9).Data;
    C3P_GAIN = example.Y(10).Data;
    C3V = example.Y(11).Data;
    C3V_GAIN = example.Y(12).Data;

    CMV = example.Y(13).Data;
    PC = example.Y(14).Data;
    RMV = example.Y(15).Data;
