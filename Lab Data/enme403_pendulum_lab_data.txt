ENME403 pendulum lab data is stored in a MATLAB structure. In
order to access the data in the MATLAB workspace, you will need
to do the following.

1.  Load the '.mat' file into MATLAB:

    >> load example.mat

    You may type the name of the resulting workspace variable
    and hit enter to view the various substructures:

    >> example

    example = 

              X: [1x1 struct]
              Y: [1x11 struct]
    Description: [1x1 struct]
      RTProgram: [1x1 struct]
        Capture: [1x1 struct]

    The 'X' structure contains timestep data, whilst the the 'Y'
    structure contains the variables that were captured at each
    timestep. Lets have a closer look at the variable structure:

    >> example.Y

    ans = 

    1x11 struct array with fields:
        Name
        Type
        Data
        Unit
        XIndex

    MATLAB has very conventiently stored the names of the ELEVEN
    variables that it captured in the 'Name' field. To see
    what the variable names are, type the following:

    >> example.Y.Name

    You will get a list of rather terse acronyms in response. The
    expanded variable names are:

    CP = Cart Position [m]
    CPF = Cart Position Gain Final
    CV = Cart Velocity [m/s]
    CVF = Cart Velocity Gain Final
    NF = Final Tracking Gain
    PC = Cart Position Command [m]
    PPF = Pendulum Position Gain Final
    PPU = Pendulum Position Up [rad]
    PV = Pendulum Velocity [rad/s]
    PVF = Pendulum Velocity Gain Final
    RMV = Raw Cart Motor Voltage [V]

    Note that the final gains are those you supplied to the TAs,
    plus any compensatory factor that may of been added.

2.  Save the 'X' and 'Y' data into the workspace:

    time_data = example.X(1).Data;
	
    cart_position = example.Y(1).Data;
    cart_position_gain = example.Y(2).Data;
    cart_velocity = example.Y(3).Data;
    cart_velocity_gain = example.Y(4).Data;
    tracking_gain = example.Y(5).Data;
    cart_position_command = example.Y(6).Data;
    pendulum_position_gain = example.Y(7).Data;
    pendulum_position = example.Y(8).Data;
    pendulum_velocity = example.Y(9).Data;
    pendulum_velocity_gain = example.Y(10).Data;
    raw_motor_voltage = example.Y(11).Data;
